## Five Rules for Good Communication

- **Facts**. Be data-driven. Use metrics. Communicate with facts first. Add emotions second. Tell a story.
- **Conviction**. Do not speculate. Do not estimate. Do not guess. Be certain. You are the expert.
- **Transparency**. Explain why you took certain decisions and discarded alternatives. Make balanced decisions.
- **Consistency**. Use clarity. Be concise. Simplify the message. Less is more. Diagrams are good.
- **Direction**. Show the road to a better place. Show vision. Assure people. Present a roadmap.
